description: What is the right balance between central bank mandate to protect forex reserves & international investments?

## TLDR
- Central bank in 3rd world countries should optimize/protect their forex reserves
- All things equal, investing local currency in foreign assets can be represented without loss of generality as equivalent to purchasing USD with local currency and then investing the USD in international financial Markets
- These two activities can be contradictory
- However, the right balance would be more optimal than either an overemphasis on either of these objectives
- Advantages of supporting forex goes without saying
- This typically leads to restriction on locally managed portfolios e.g. pension funds in international Markets

- But there are advantages to investing in international markets:
   - it provides more investment opportunities 
      - more asset classes means more robust portfolio and investment risk management, including 
      - more liquidity supports retirement needs are met in a timely manner
      - Helps manage inflation risk of pension funds implicitly (hedging local currency depreciation against USD as general trend has been loss of local currency value relative to USD)
