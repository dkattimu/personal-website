## Introduction

The concept of free-will is a metaphysical one though the concept intersects with other fields of study including ethics, science (biology, physics, etc.). The concept and concomitant debate has since entered into the zeitgeist as well as evidenced by hits on youtube for searches related to "Free will". Judging anecdotally by popular culture, it would seems "the smart kids on the block" have conclused that there is no such thing as free will. 

We do think the debate is sometimes unproductive due semantic imprecision. Though there are instances where semantics matter little, it is clearly not the case with this debate. A classical example of the former is describing a glass as half-full or half-empty as the two semantic categorizations are equivalent. An example of the latter case is the question under consideration i.e. whether free-will exists. Any coherent discussion of this debate can only occur with a precise (or as precise as possible) definition of the concept of free will. For example one could define free will to mean absolute independence from any external influence. Another definition could mean ability to act contrary to any external influence. These definitions are different and the claim of the existence or otherwise of free will under these definitions have different implications.

To that end, we will start with a definition of the concept of free-will and show that arguments for or against the concept are seldom clear and the conclusions as obvious
as some may like or even pretend it to be. We will also show that no-one actually believes in a certain understanding of the absence of free will.

## Determinisim, Compatibilism & Incompatibilism
The three concepts of determinism, compatibilism and incompatibilism are fundamental to the discusion and we address them next.
### Determinism
We start with the concept of determinism which is defined in [1] as:

_" 
 the view that for every event that happens, there are are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could have happened"_.

Another definition from [3]:

_"Determinism is true of the world if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time $t$, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law "_

This may not be debatable when applied to inorganic entities. In other words, inanimate objects evolve based on the laws of Physics but the intuitive sense of many is that animate objects e.g. those with agency can impose different "initial" conditions that change the evolution; the evolution however is still subject to the laws of physics which without loss of generality can be specified using differential equations. For example, suppose I landed on a planet in a galaxy far away, found a bar of impure gold and then proceeded to refine it. Prior to my finding the this impure bar, conventional scientific position would be that elementary particles evolved based on initial conditions at the begining of the universe based on differential equations through time to its state when I found it. My refinement proceses are equivalent to setting different initial conditions to the equations(s) that describe the state of the gold bar to arrive at the purified state thereof. There is hardly any debate with such an understanding.


However, once we extend my actions above to be also subject to same deterministic differential equations (using transitivity i.e. I am also made of matter, with the underlying elementary particles that satisfy differential equations subject to initial conditions), we are in the teritorry of heated debate. Why? Note that the definition above applies to _any event_; it makes no distinction between events due to the laws of Physics acting on inanimate objects or those actions by sentient beings. 

### Compatibilism & Incompatibilism
We will stick with the essential implications of these two ideas. Compatibilism claims that free-will is consistent with determinism.

Incompatibilsm on the other hand assets that free-will is inconsistent with determinism. Thus according to compatibilism, if free will exists, then determinism is not true or vice versa.

As noted in the introduction earlier, the conversation is only as coherent as the definition of free will being used.

## Disambiguating the Core Issues
We first note the following sequence (See Section 2.3.2 in [3]):

 desire/urge $\to$ delibration $\to$ decision $\to$ action. ... (*)
 
 In this sequel, we will stop at the decision and not proceed to action. We will extend this to the action phase.
 
 Consider an individual has agency if they could decide based on their own volition. Indeed, this does not preclude the influence of other factors on such decision. We will call this **first order functional free will**. For example, individual, $I$ passes by candy on the table. She has the free will to pick it up or not. This is first order functional free will; though there could be urges to the contrary, the individual could think their way through following the urge(s) or otherwise. 
 
 Now, one could argue (and arguably the loudest clan in the free will is not a thing group tribe) that factors outside the control of the individual compeled/coerced the decision. The latter effect will be categorized under the existence or otherwise of **second order functional free will**
 We note that the existence of FOFFW is a weaker condition that SOFFW. It presuposes that $I$ has the free agency to make a choice e.g. overrule his environment & concomitant urges based on an innate sense of "good judgment".

 Lack of SOFFW would however undermine the general concept of the existence of free will. Afterall how much credit can be attributed to $I$ if he is merely a "machine" driven by the laws of nature? Indeed it would mean that innate sense of "good judgement" is not innate at all but 100% caused by factors outside the individual.

A popular notion is that, inanimate objects evolve based on the laws of Physics and animate objects e.g. those with agency can impose different "initial" conditions that change the evolution; the evolution however is still subject to the laws of physics which without loss of generality can be specified using differential equations. However, lack of SOFFW would argue in addition that given that any animate agent is made up of elementary particles that are subject to (deterministic) laws, their actions (e.g. of imposing different initial conditions) is also a purely mechanistic process. Ergo, we only have an illustion of agency since aspects of that agency are caused 100% by the laws of Physics and any relevant initial conditions imposed on nature prior to the decision.

We presuppose that similar to urges/predispositions up to time $t_*$, an individual's decision is  influenced by $(\mathcal E_t)_{t\le t_*}$, the history of the world up to $t_*$

- We rule out coersion which is one end of the spectrum e.g. one where an electrode attached to the brain of $I$ causes the particular decision; this obviously precludes free will even of the 1st functional type. 
- 
We believe distinguishing between coercive vs non-coercive influence is key to this debate:
In other words, an influence is not always sufficient for a decision. If it were, the decision would not be free
To get to the core issues at play, we will categorize free will into the retrospective and prospective. We define retrospective free-will posibility of an agent

## Appendix: A Mathematical Approach to Disambiguation
**Definition 1 [Determinism, see [2]]**

Determinism is the governing property of a world if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time $t$, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law.

To proceed, we start by establishing some notation. 
- Let an individual $I$ at time $t$ be subject to an environment (including history up to $t$) be $\mathbb E_t$. Indeed it is follows naturally that $\mathbb E_s \subset \mathbb E_t$ for $s\le t$. 
We define $\mathbb E = \displaystyle\bigcup_{t\in \R_+} \mathbb E_t$. 
- Let $\mathbb W_t$ be the universe of 'will'/decision that an individual can exercise at time $t$. We will later endow $\mathbb W_t$ with a sigma algebra, $\Sigma^{\mathbb W_t}$ and (probability) measure $\mathbb P^{\mathbb W_t}$, i.e. $(\mathbb W_t, \Sigma_t, \mathbb P^{\mathbb W_t})$. Similarly, we define $\mathbb W := \displaystyle\bigcup_{t\in \R_+} \mathbb W_t$

- Let $\mathbb D_t$ represent the universe of decisions that an individual, $I$ can make at time, $t$. We will endow this set with a metric, $\rho^\mathbb D_t$ resulting in the metric space, $(\mathbb D_t, \rho^\mathbb D_t)$ as well as a sigma algebra, $\Sigma^\mathbb D_t$ and (probability) measure $\mathbb P_t^\mathbb D$, resulting in a probability measure space $(\mathbb D_t, \Sigma_t, \mathbb P^{\mathbb D_t})$. Again, we define $\mathbb D := \displaystyle \bigcup_{t\in \R_+}\mathbb D_t$. 
- Let $\mathbb A_t$ be the set of all actions (typically as a result of a decision at $t$). We will endow this set with a metric, $\rho^\mathbb A_t$ resulting in the metric space, $(\mathbb A_t, \rho^\mathbb A_t)$ as well as a sigma algebra, $\Sigma^\mathbb W _t$ and (probability) measure $\mathbb P_t^\mathbb A$, resulting in a probability measure space $(\mathbb A_t, \Sigma_t, \mathbb P_t)$ Again, we define $\mathbb A := \displaystyle \bigcup_{t\in \R_+}\mathbb A_t$. 


 We call the function:
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta^I : \R_+& \to \mathcal F(\mathbb E \times \mathbb W , \mathbb D)\\
               t & \mapsto  \delta_t^I(\cdot, \cdot) : \mathbb E_t \times \mathbb W_t\to \mathbb D_t 
\end{align}
$$
where $\mathcal F(\mathbb E \times \mathbb W , \mathbb D)$ is the function space of all functions from $\mathbb E \times \mathbb W$ to $\mathbb D$, the _the decision function_

**Definition 2 [Precise Free Will Set]**

The set defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb W_t^{I,\text{c-free}} := \Big\{\ \omega \in \mathbb W_t \big| \exists \,\omega' \in \mathbb W_t/\{\omega\} \, : \,\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb E_t, \,\, \delta^I_t(\varepsilon, \omega')\ne \delta^I_t(\varepsilon, \omega)\Big\}
\end{align}
$$
is called the _precise/certain free will set_. If $\mathbb W_t^I \ne \emptyset$, we say $I$ has free will with respect to the decision problem at time $t$. Otherwise, $I$ has no such free will.

We expatiate on this defintion below:
- The precise free will set is the subset of possible mental postures of an individual for which given an environment at the time of decision, the actual decision is different **for different postures**
  - If this set is non-empty, it means different decisions are certainly possible i.e. with probability 1. 
  - If this set is empty, it implies decision is fixed i.e. there is no set of the individuals agency for which the decision would differ.
- For actions that already occured, the assertion of a precise free will set is by defnition a counterfactual.

Next we motivate a probabilistic view of these ideas thusly:

Given an environment $\varepsilon^I_t$ of $I$ at time $t$, recall that:
$$
\delta^I_t(\varepsilon_t, \cdot) : \mathbb W_t \to \mathbb D
$$

Now we endow, $\mathbb W_t$ with the sigma algebra as noted above and $\mathbb D_t$ with the sigma algebra $\Sigma_t^\mathbb D$

 **Definition 3 [Probabilistic Free Will Set]**

The set defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb W_t^I := \Big\{\ \omega \in \mathbb W_t \big| \exists \,\omega' \in \mathbb W_t/\{\omega\} \, : \,\forall \varepsilon \in \mathbb E_t, \,\, \delta^I_t(\varepsilon, \omega')\ne \delta^I_t(\varepsilon, \omega)\Big\}
\end{align}
$$
is called the _certainty free will set_. If $\mathbb S_t^I \ne \emptyset$, we say $I$ has free will with respect to the decision problem at time $t$. Otherwise, $I$ has no such free will.

We expatiate on this defintion below:
- The precise free will set is the subset of possible mental postures of an individual for which given an environment at the time of decision, the actual decision is different **for different postures**
   - If this set is non-empty, it means different decisions are certainly possible i.e. with probability 1. 
  - If this set is empty, it implies decision is fixed i.e. there is no set of the individuals agency for which the decision would differ.

  

Dennet vs Sapolsky:
- Can $I$ make choices
- Are choices made by $I$ or "made for"  $I$?
- Both positions are consistent with $\omega$ being influenced by environment. Difference is that of whether given an individual and environment, actions are deterministic. For historical occurences, this is a counterfactual.


Mathematically, Sapolsky's position is essentially that for all individuals and all time, any state of the will is completely exogenous i.e. $\mathbb
