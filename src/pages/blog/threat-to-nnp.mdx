description: Arguably a saner approach to nuclear non-proliferation than what the experts have utilized so far
---

## TLDR
- Nuclear non-proliferation describes efforts to prevent spread of nuclear weapons to nations that do not posses them and prevent the increase in existing stocks of those that do.
- A number of countries are believed to or/
and acknowledged their possession of nuclear weapons. These include the major nuclear powers of Russia, USA, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel & North Korea, in decreasing order of number of warheads [^is-nukes].

[^is-nukes]: https://www.icanw.org/nuclear_arsenals (Retrieved 10/28/2024). Note that the Israeli goverment has not officially acknowledged that it has nukes, it is widely believed that it has.

- Irespective of "good" motives, the intervention in Libya was misguided and has resulted in disastrous consequences. One big consequence is that it throws a big wrench into non-proliferation goals that NATO supports.

- If the State dept is serious about nuclear non-proliferation, there should be iron-clad orthodoxy framework to deal with leaders that give up their nuclear weapons that is based on realities of how incentives affect human actions.

- The fundamental framework should be that, any leader that makes meaningful concessions on nukes should have a _credible_ reward of "immunity". This raises questions of granting implicit impunity to such leaders. However, this immunity isn't immunity from all consequences; it is immunity from active regime change efforts by those to whom nuclear concessions are made. 


## The Libya Case
Libya pre 2011 was consistently among the top-ranking countries in Africa based on gdp-per capita. In 2011, there was a civil war that challenged the leadership of the countries long-reigning leader, Muammar Gaddafi. Under objective observable standards, Gaddafi's rule delivered positive economic results for Libya. On the other hand, sundry evidence have been adduced regarding human rights abuses of dissenters, together with support for a number of rebel forces in civil wars across the African continent. 

Prior to the civil war, Gaddafi had a weapons program that was believed to include nukes. However, he gave those up in an attempt at rapproachment with the West after the invasion of Iraq in 2003[^only-adv]. Indeed, these actions and signals culminated in a meeting with then Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. It has also been revealed that Gaddafi had a "crush" on the former secretary of state[^crush].
[^only-adv]: It is now widely accepted that the justification for this invasion was flawed. Some claim it was a failure of intelligence, whereas others point to a pattern which either a consious or sub-concious propensity of the so-called military industrial complex to profit, among other hypotheses. We do not make a judgement on these debatable and "invisible" motives of the key players, but stake the claim the outcome has been a net negative. On the other hand, the only arguably positive outcome of that invasion was the decision by Gadaffi to give up his weapons program. This positive outcome was then quickly negated by NATO actions in Libya.

When the civil war erupted, NATO [^nato] directly intervened, directly leading to the deposition and death of Muammar Gaddafi. 
[^nato]: This was effectively the US, becasue though France was leading the operations (and as President Obama infamously said, the US led from behind), the intervention wouldn't have happened if there was objection from President Obama. US efforts were also higher than those of France. 

In an interview with ABC news in 2011[^abc-int], after Gaddafi's demise, Condoleezza Rice acknowledged the apparent fascination (or maybe obsession) of Gaddafi with her. Evidence of that includes Gadaffi creating a picture album showing her with world leaders, followed by an original song by a top Libyan composer called "Black Flower in the White House". In that same interview, Rice outlined that the aim of the visit was to deliver the "quid quo pro" after Libya gave up WMD's. She later mentioned that though the priority was to get Libya out of terrorism and get Gadaffi away from WMD's, "it's was far preferrable that he is gone".
Here is the problem with this:
- It was diplomatically misguided to make such statements about it being better to that he was gone "in public" after the events that transpired. How does that impact attempts down the road to either coax a smaller nuclear power down the road to give up their nukes?
- A precedence had been set that the US cannot be trusted in this particular matter. Though a case can be made that foreign policy-related promises made by one US administration should be adhered to by other administrations, such a general rule might be problematic; it effectively locks-in potentially bad foreign policy decisions by prior administration. We will thus stick to the particular special case pertaining to non-proliferation. 
- Instead, when a nation's leader agrees to give up its weapons program, key stakeholders (NATO) should manage that regime to it's conclusion without overthrowing the leader. This is not a risk-free proposition but we maintain the alternative increases geopolitical risk.[^trust]
- In addition, with the current geopolitical realities [^geopol], we may as well kiss the goal of nuclear proliferation goodbye and expect that countries like North Korea would not give up their nukes unless somehow a new leader that was enamored with the west came into power.
- NATO by increasing risk of overthrow of a leader with nukes, led to the situation uhere the world effectively has to deal with e.g. a nuclear NK for longer. Wouldn't it have been better to manage the Gadaffi situation better, providing an incentive to have NK eliminate it's nukes before the end of their current leader's rule [^cynic]?
[^geopol]: Before the Ukrainian war, all countries at least pretended to be for de-nuclearization of the Korean Penninsular. With the current rift, Russia is formally aligned with NK. She has at least apparently shown that the West's system of sanctions can be survived. 
[^cynic]: OK, the cynic might say even if the West intended not to still overthrow leaders who gave up their nukes, why not at least wait to have the most dangerous of leaders give up their nukes first before working against them openly? Though we don't endorse such an approach, we believe competent beauraucrats should at the minimum have preferred such a strategy.

[^trust]:  At the minimum, a more optimal strategy would have been to ensure at one extreme to coerce (behind the scenes) to resign and be exiled or embark on any intervention only

[^abc-int]: https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/condoleezza-rice-on-her-eerie-encounter-with-gadhafi-how-quickly-can-i-get-out-of-here (retrieved 10/30/2024)

Though we empathize with the sentiments of some that Gadaffi had done bad things [^gadaffi-evils] and thus deserved his fate, we contend that in the grand scheme of things, the actions of NATO were bone-headed and lacked any deeper strategic thought. 

[^gadaffi-evils]: Those we empathize with include families of terrorist attacks he was complicit in, victims of brutal civil wars, e.g. Liberia, Sierra Leone where he funded/supported the rebel groups, victims of notorious leaders like Idi Amin that he supported. 

## A better Strategy
We propose a more optimal abstract rule for this case. This is: a leader[^dictator] that gives up their nukes should not be "regime-changed" by stakeholders including US/NATO. How should that have been handled in Libya? On the one hand, NATO could have negotiated a middle-ground in the civil war. It had leverage on both sides : threat of direct intervention (which should have been expertly weilded behind closed doors), while making similar leverage could be weilded on the rebels as well. The goal would be to ensure that other leaders with nukes dismiss/minimize the risk of given up leverage as a result. We do realize the real world is messy but ultimately managing Gadaffi to the end of his reign would have been a much better outcome.

We pre-empt some objections to the strategy above which would be along the lines of "he was killing his own people". That may be true, but in a war, each side is trying to kill the other side. In addition, we got what the experts wanted and what has been the result? A failed Libyan state. Gadaffi's arsenal has been reported to fall into the hands of insurgent groups in the area. There is strong evidence to suggest that has been a boon resulting in insurgent activities in all the further south in countries like Burkina Faso (just north of the coastal nation of Ghana in West Africa)


[^dictator]: We do not use terms like "dictator" in this article not because we think none of the characters fit such a discription; we believe a zietgeist that is sensitive to the feeling of people is out of it's mind in insisting that antagonizing a group of individuals that have within their ability the means to cause extreme catastrophe. 

## Current Geo-Political Realities
The regime of sanctions has lost any perception of fatality given Russia's ability to withstand them. In addition, the management of the Ukraine-Russia conflict is another case study in an epic bungling of tools of diplomacy by the West.[^validity]

## Conclusion
We have made the argument that by insular and seemingly knee-jerk reactions of the foreign policy establishment, US foreign policy experts have sabotaged the long-term strategic imperitives that have been signaled. It is sometimes difficult to explain how seemingly experienced, well-educated and credentialed people make such strategically unwise decisions, but here we are.

[^validity]: This article is not about staking moral claims and/or declarations regarding "democray", "dictatorships", justification of either side's actions etc. Serveral such talk/articles exist on the internet; we don't intend to add to that genre of work. In this article we take a pragmatic posture in addressing the crux of the issues, decisions and implications thereof. In addition, we expect a modicum of intellectual maturity of the reader. This is the acumen to differentiate between a prediction or explanation of an outcome vs an endorsement of said outcome.
