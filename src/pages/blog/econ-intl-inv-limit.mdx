## Introduction
Central banks in developing countries should optimize/protect their forex reserves
Conceptually, investing local currency in foreign assets is equivalent to purchasing USD with local currency and then investing the USD in international financial markets. This is an example of a capital outflow.
The goal of protecting a local central bank's reserve is contradictory to allowing capital outflows.
Co
nsequently, the local central banks typically place constraints on capital outfows with the goal of protecting their (central bank's) forex reserves. The restriction of interest to us in this article is the maximum allocation of investments of institutional investors in general, and pension funds in particular to foreign assets. 
- Advantages of supporting forex goes without saying
- This typically leads to restriction on locally managed portfolios e.g. pension funds in international Markets

- But there are advantages to investing in international markets:
   - it provides more investment opportunities 
      - more asset classes means more robust portfolio and investment risk management, including 
      - more liquidity supports retirement needs are met in a timely manner
      - Helps manage inflation risk of pension funds implicitly (hedging local currency depreciation against USD as general trend has been loss of local currency value relative to USD)

## Capital Outflows via Investments - The Bad News
To keep this simple, we will focus on the supply and demand of foreign exchange (forex). We assume the central bank forex reserves are in USD (alternatively, we could consider only the USD component of the local central bank's forex reserves). The local central bank has foreign exchang reserves as one category of assets on its balance sheet. When USD is needed e.g. to pay of imports, to pay for USD-denominated assets, the central bank sells the USD to say local banks and 

capital outflows in this article refer to local investors investing in foreign (USD)-denominated assets. To invest in foreign assets, local currency is used to purchase USD. From the central bank's perspective:
-This results in a reduction of USD in reserve while increasing the local currency on the central banks BS. If the central bank purchases more USD to maintain it's r
eserve, this puts a downward pressure on local currency value relative to the USD.


## Repartiation of USD to local Currency

Under the assumption that the local currency generally depreciates relative to the USD, here are the effects of repartration of investment into local currency:
 - The local central bank has an infusion of USD and in turn release more local economy local currency. 
   - This increases the central bank's USD reserves providing upward pressure on local currency's value relative to the USD. 
   - Under the initial assumption and the conventional relationship between inflation and depreciation of local currency, in the short term, repartrated USD will at least compensate for inflation [^cap-prot]. This means any
