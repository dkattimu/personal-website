description: Faith in a Biblical sense is not "belief for something for which there is no proof".

## TLDR
- Detractors use the definition of faith as "belief for which there is no proof".
- This definition does not coincide with Biblical faith. Even if we granted that definition, we would insist on a "mathematical" definition of proof to go with it
- in reality, faith in Christian theological framework is more akin to extrapolating confidence/belief to God on areas not directly evidenced based on foundational evidence in other areas. This is just how humans live their lives e.g. Scientists believe what the literature concludes based on evidence that the Peer review process works. [^1st-prin] 

[^1st-prin]: Indeed, it is not practical for an individual to prove all scientific results from first principles; they rely on (have faith in) prior work. 

- The so-called scientific method is based on faith i.e. belief in things that cannot be proven logically. 
  - Hume proved that induction (the most ubiquitious approach to ascertaining scientific truths) is logically incoherent. However, no one bats an eye on relying on it. Indeed this is not believing without evidence, it is technically believing against evidence that there is logical incoherence in the inductive approach.
  - Someone who "believes" in the "scientific methdo" denigrating one who has religous faith for believing things without proof is quite rich.
  - The laws of logic which are utilized in the scientific process do not have "proofs". They are axiomatic or fundational. In other words, they are assumed to be true. That is another way of saying we have "faith" in their truth/validity. Yes, these laws are coherent and we have evidence that they "work", but anytime we approach the scientific enterprise based on these laws, it is an article of faith to expect these laws to still hold or be useful. By extension, application of the inductive approach presuposes this logically incoherent framework will (per Hume's proof) still possesses practical utility; it does work resulting an sundry scientific marvels.
