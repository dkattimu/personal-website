description: Arguably a saner approach to nuclear non-proliferation than what the experts have utilized so far
---

## TLDR
- Nuclear non-proliferation describes efforts to prevent spread of nuclear weapons to nations that do not posses them and prevent the increase in existing stocks of those that do.
- A number of countries are believed to or/
and acknowledged their possession of nuclear weapons. These include the major nuclear powers of Russia, USA, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel & North Korea, in decreasing order of number of warheads [^is-nukes].

[^is-nukes]: The Israeli goverment has not officially acknowledged that it has nukes, it is widely believed that it has.

- There are sundry reason's why intervention (irrespective of "good" motives) was misguided and has resulted in disastrous consequences. One big consequence is that it throws a big wrench into non-proliferation goals that NATO supports.

- If the State dept is serious about nuclear non-proliferation, there should be iron-clad orthodoxy on fundamental issues like how to deal with leaders that give up their nuclear weapons.

## Case Study - Libya
Libya pre 2011 was consistently among the top-ranking countries in Africa based on gdp-per capita. In 2011, there was a civil war that challenged the leadership of the countries long-reigning leader, Muammar Gaddafi. Under objective observable standards, Gaddafi's rule delivered positive economic results for Libya. On the other hand, sundry evidence have been adduced regarding human rights abuses of dissenters, together with support for a number of rebel forces in civil wars across the African continent. 

Prior to the civil war, Gaddafi was believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons. However, he gave those up in an attempt at rapproachment with the West. Indeed, these actions and signals culminated in a meeting with then Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. It has also been revealed that Gaddafi had a "crush" on the former secretary of state[^crush].

When the civil war erupted, NATO [^nato] directly intervened, directly leading to the deposition and death of Muammar Gaddafi. 
[^nato]: This was effectively the US, becasue though France was leading the operations (and as President Obama infamously said, the US led from behind), the intervention wouldn't have happened if there was objection from President Obama. US efforts were also higher than those of France. 

In an interview with ABC news in 2011[^abc-int], after Gaddafi's demise, Condoleezza Rice acknowledged the apparent fascination (or maybe obsession) of Gaddafi with her. Evidence of that includes Gadaffi creating a picture album showing her with world leaders, followed by an original song by a top Libyan composer called "Black Flower in the White House". In that same interview, Rice outlined that the aim of the visit was to deliver the "quid quo pro" after Libya gave up WMD's. She later mentioned that though the priority was to get Libya out of terrorism and get Gadaffi away from WMD's, "it's was far preferrable that he is gone".
Here is the problem with this:
- It was diplomatically misguided to make such statements about it being better to that he was gone "in public" after the events that transpired. How does that impact attempts down the road to either coax a smaller nuclear power down the road to give up their nukes?
- A precedence had been set that the US cannot be trusted in this particular matter. Though a case can be made that foreign policy-related promises made by one US administration should be adhered to by other administrations but such a general rule might be problematic; it effectively locks in potentially bad foreign policy decisions by prior administration. We will thus stick to the particular special case pertaining to non-proliferation. Instead, as pertaining to a nation's leader agreeing to give up its weapons program, not keeping promises leads to increased risk.[^trust]; together with the current geopolitical realities, we may as well kiss the goal of nuclear proliferation goodbye and expect that countries like North Korea would not give up their nukes unless somehow a new leader that was enamored with the west came into power.

[^trust]:  At the minimum a more optimal strategy would have been to ensure at one extreme to coerce (behind the scenes) to resign and be exiled or embark on any intervention only

Though we empathize with the sentiments of some that Gadaffi had done bad things [^gadaffi-evils] and thus deserved his fate, we contend that in the grand scheme of things, the actions of NATO were bone-headed and lacked any deeper strategic thought. 

[^gadaffi-evils]: Those we empathize with include families of terrorist attacks he was complicit in, victims of brutal civil wars, e.g. Liberia, Sierra Leone where he funded/supported the rebel groups, victims of notorious leaders like Idi Amin that he supported. 

## A better Strategy
We propose a more optimal abstract rule for this case. This rule is: any leader [^dictator]

[^dictator]: We do not use terms like "dictator" in this article not because we do not think some characters do not fit such a discription but the term has been overused so as to loose any 

## Current Geo-Political Realities
Regime of sanctions has lost any perception of fatality given Russia's ability to withstand them. In addition, the management of the Ukraine-Russia conflict is another case study in an epic bungling of tools of diplomacy by the West.[^validity]

[^validity]: This article is not about staking moral claims and/or declarations regarding "democray", "dictatorships", justification of either side's actions etc. Serveral such talk/articles exist on the internet; we don't intend to add to that genre of work. In this article we take a pragmatic posture in addressing the crux of the issues, decisions and implications thereof. In addition, we expect a modicum of intellectual maturity of the reader. This is the acumen to differentiate between a prediction of an outcome vs an endorsement of said outcome.
