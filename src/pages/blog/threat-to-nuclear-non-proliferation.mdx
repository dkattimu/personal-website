## TLDR
- A number of countries are believed to or/
and acknowledged their possession of nuclear weapons. These include the major nuclear powers of Russia, USA, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel[^is-nukes] & North Korea, in decreasing order of number of warheads according to [1]

[^is-nuke]: The Israeli goverment has not officially acknowledged that it has nukes, it is widely believed that it has.

- The goal has been at the minimum prevent other nations from joining the ranks above and methodically work towards reduction in war-heads (pragmatic goal) and maybe complete irradication of these weapons (this seems quite unlikely given the inherent incentives)
- The above two activities can be contradictory
- The local central banks typically place constraints on capital outfows with the goal of protecting their (central b

## Case Study - Libya
Libya pre 2011 was consistently among the top-ranking countries in Africa based on gdp-per capita. In 2011, there was a civil war that challenged the leadership of the countries long-reigning leader, Muammar Gaddafi. Under objective observable standards, Gaddafi's rule delivered positive economic results for Libya. On the other hand, sundry evidence have been adduced regarding human rights abuses of dissenters, together with support for a number of rebel forces in civil wars across the African continent. 

Prior to the civil war, Gaddafi was believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons. However, he gave those up in an attempt at rapproachment with the West. Indeed, these actions and signals culminated in a meeting with then Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. It has also been revealed that Gaddafi had a "crush" on the former secretary of state[^crush].

When the civil war erupted, NATO [^nato] directly intervened and eventually led to the deposition and death of Muammar Gaddafi. 
[^nato] This was effectively the US as though France was leading the operations and as President Obama infamously said that the US led from behind in the operation, the intervention wouldn't have happened if there was objection from President Obama. 

In an interview with ABC news in 2011[^abc-int], after Gaddafi's demise, Condoleezza Rice acknowledged the apparent fascination (or maybe obsession) of Gaddafi with her. Evidence of that includes Gadaffi creating a picture album showing her with world leaders, followed by an original song by a top Libyan composer called "Black Flower in the White House". In that same interview, Rice outlined that the aim of the visit was to deliver the "quid quo pro" after Libya gave up WMD's. She later mentioned that though the priority was to get Libya out of terrorism and get Gadaffi away from WMD's, "it's was far preferrable that he is gone".

Here is the problem with this:
- It was diplomatically misguided to make such statements "in public"
- A precidence had been set that the US cannot be trusted; together with the current geopolitical realities, we may as well kiss the goal of nuclear proliferation goodbye
- At the minimum a more optimal strategy would have been to ensure at one extreme to coerce (behind the scenes) to resign and be exiled or embark on any intervention only

Though we empathize with the sentiments of some that Gadaffi had done bad things [^gadaffi-evils] and deserved his fate, we contend that in the grand scheme of things, the actions of NATO were bone-headed and lacked any deeper strategic thought. The pronouncements by key leaders does not help either.

[^gadaffi-evils]: Those we empathize with include families of terrorist attacks he was complicit in, victims of brutal civil wars, e.g. Liberia, Sierra Leone where he funded/supported the rebel groups, victims of notorious leaders like Idi Amin that he supported. 



## Current Geo-political Realities
Regime of sanctions has lost any perception of fatality given Russia's ability to withstand them. In addition, the management of the Ukraine-Russia conflict is another case study in an epic bungling of tools of diplomacy by the West.[^validity]

[^validity]: This article is not about staking moral claims and/or declarations regarding "democray", "dictatorships", justification of either side's actions etc. Serveral such talk/articles exist on the internet; we don't intend to add to that genre of work. In this article we take a pragmatic posture in addressing the crux of the issues, decisions and implications thereof. In addition, we expect a modicum of intellectual maturity of the reader. This is the acumen to differentiate between a prediction of an outcome vs an endorsement of said outcome.
