## Introduction

The concept of free-will is a metaphysical one that arises both in atheistic and theistic philosophical circles.Indeed, it translates into popular culture as well. It seems "the smart kids on the block" have conclused that there is no free will.
From our perspective, this is another example of ambiguous communication that we will try to disambiguate as much as possible in this article.
To do that, we will start with a definition of the concept of free-will and show that arguments for or against the concept are seldom clear and the conclusions as obvious
as some may like or even pretend it to be. We will also show that no-one actually believes in a certain understanding of the absence of free will.

## Colloquial Use of the Term Free Will
In the colloquial sense, the claim of "free will does not exist" seems to indicate the notion that choices that are made by individuals are exclusively determined by factors outside their control.

I would concede that for any action by an individual $\mathcal I$, that actioin is influenced by an environment $E$. This environment for this article refers to any influence on the decision including historical experience, genetics, one's emotion, etc. The position that there is no free-will misguided at the minimum. The reason is that though ones environment can _influence_ a decision/action, it does not necessarily _compel_ the same.

## Determinisim & Compatibilism
Compatibilism in a nutshell accepts determinism as largely true while asserting that there is some level of chaos/pertubations to the deterministic drivers of action. Compatibilism thus supports the notion of influence of the will but not the determination of the will.

Another school of thought rejects any form of determinism i.e. non compatibilist
This contrasts with n

## Appendix: A Mathematical Approach to Disambiguation
**Definition[Determinism, see [2]]**

Determinism is the governing property of a world if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time $t$, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law.

To proceed, we start by establishing some notation. 
- Let an individual $I$ at time $t$ be subject to an environment (including history up to $t$) be $\mathbb E_t$. Indeed it is follows naturally that $\mathbb E_s \subset \mathbb E_t$ for $s\le t$. 
We define $\mathbb E = \displaystyle\bigcup_{t\in \R_+} \mathbb E_t$. 
- Let $\mathbb W_t$ be the universe of 'will'/decision that an individual can exercise at time $t$. We will later endow $\mathbb W_t$ with a sigma algebra, $\Sigma_t$ and (probability) measure $\mathbb P$, i.e. $(\mathbb W_t, \Sigma_t, \mathbb P_t)$. Similarly, we define $\mathbb W := \displaystyle\bigcup_{t\in \R_+} \mathbb W_t$

- Let $\mathbb D_t$ represent the universe of decisions that an individual, $I$ can make at time, $t$. We will endow this set with a metric, $d_t$ resulting in the metric space, $(\mathbb D_t, d_t)$ 

 We call the function:
$$
\Delta^I : \R_+\times \mathbb E_t \times \mathbb W_t \to (\mathbb D, d)
$$

**Definition[Free will]**




$\varepsilon(t) \equiv \varepsilon(t, \{\varepsilon(s)\}_{s<t})$

An easy way of clarifying this position would be to note that if $\alpha^{\mathcal I}(E, \omega)$ is the decision/action of an individual $\mathcal I$ subject to environment $E$ and where the strength of the free-will of the individual is $\omega$, then a mathematical statement of lack of free will will be:
$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^{\mathcal I}(E_1, \omega) &\ne \alpha^{\mathcal I}(E_2, \omega), \,\,\forall\, \omega, \text{ and }  E_1\ne E_2\\
\alpha^{\mathcal I}(E, \omega_1) &= \alpha^{\mathcal I}(E, \omega_2) \,\, \forall\, E, \text{ and } \omega_1 \ne \omega_2
\end{align}
$$
The expression (1) says that even with the same level of free will, different environments will lead to different decisions/outcomes while  (2) asserts that given an environment prior to decision/action, the level of free-will has no impact on the decision.
