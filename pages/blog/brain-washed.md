# Thinking in the Age of Sensationalism

## Framing
 - Misleading by framing

 ## Sidestepping the Issues
 - Masks are Ineffective vs Masks are Effective
    - Listening to this debate or folks taking one position or the other (experts on cable TV, can you hear me?) the dispute exists because either side is _pretending_ that they are arguing whether _Masks are always effective in preventing COVID transmission_ vs _Masks are never effective in preventing COVID transmission_

 - Then we have quotations of studies proving that puports to validate one of the above positions

 - Real question should be _Under what conditions are masks effective in preventing COVID transmission?_

 - The general public does not need to be experts in the hydraulics of droplets containing the virus to note the following:
   1) There are other variables that would impact the effectiveness of any mask wearing
   2) These variables will most likely not have the same level of importance/impact
   3) They are likely examples of cases where folks adheering to masking have transmitted or been infected
   4) There are likely examples of cases where unmasked folks haven't transmitted or been infected
- Ultimately, unlike in pure mathematics where if something is proved, you can bank on it (of course, not every mathematical statement can be proved, thanks to a Mathematician called Kurt Godell's discovery), in the real world, there is always an element of uncertainty (indeed pronouncements that _pretend_ that something is scientifically settled are just that; they are pretences as that is not a thing! Note that not all _science_ is created equal. If you dispute that, ask yourself what percentage of your net worth you would bet that a _scientific_ prediction by NASA scientists of an eclipse of the moon occuring at a particular time/location will be realized vs a _scientific_ prediction about the weather by a meteorologist or better still, a prediction by a social scientist based on some _scientific_ analysis of some social phenomenon. If you do this exercise fairly, with the assumption that your money is on the line, you wouldn't need any convincing or impressive _scientific_ sounding argument that not all _science_ is created equal in terms of the level of certainty that can be placed on them)

Another area where you have half-baked positioning is when there is a _scientific_ prediction about how something would be catastrophic in some number of years, n, if so and so is not done. Again, there may well be valid issues being raised but pretending such statements are are in the same _scientific_ category as Newton's laws of motion, or that the _science_ behind the validity of rockets design, is again just that; pretense. These are not in the same category. The reader can perform the same thought experiment about what fraction of their net worth they would bet on the working of the former category of _science_ vs the _latter_.

This is an distinction between credibility and truth. Note that the something being not credible is not the same as it being false. However, credibility plays a huge role in decision making for humans. Idea is to utilize credibility in such a way that makes it easier to get to the truth.
