## Introduction

## Preliminaries
We start with an underlying probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ endowed with the filteration $\mathcal F_k$ which is increasing in $k$. Consider an economy with $n+1$ assets, $S_k(\omega) :=\Big(S^{0}_k(\omega), \cdots, S^{n}_k(\omega)\Big)$ 


## Evolution of A Portfolio
Consider $k$ to be time prior to rebalancing and $k^+$ the time of rebalancing.
Recall that the strategy $\varphi_k \in \mathcal F_{k-1}$, whereas $S_k(\omega)\in\mathcal F_k$
