## Introduction
Hedging of a contingent claim, $\mathcal X$ can be defined as mechanism of enshuring the claim can be met met when it comes due. Let the value of the claim 

## Preliminaries
We start with an underlying probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb P)$ endowed with the filteration $\mathcal F_k$ which is increasing in $k$. Consider an economy with $n+1$ assets, $S_k(\omega) :=\Big(S^{0}_k(\omega), \cdots, S^{n}_k(\omega)\Big)$ 
Consider a liability whose value at time $t$ along a path (state of the world $\omega$) and depends on a number of $n$ variables, $\bold X(\omega) :=\big(X^1_t(\omega), \cdots, X^n_t(\omega)\big)$. 
Let the liability be defined as a function:
$$
\begin{aligned}
L : \R^{n+1}& \to \R\\
  (t, X^1, \cdots, X^n) &\mapsto  L(t, \bold X) 
\end{aligned}
$$
We will typically drop the dependence on $\omega$ and $t$ 

## Evolution of A Portfolio
Consider $k$ to be time prior to rebalancing and $k^+$ the time of rebalancing.
Recall that the strategy $\varphi_k \in \mathcal F_{k-1}$, whereas $S_k(\omega)\in\mathcal F_k$

## Example: A Call on an underlying $S$
Consider a dealer that writes an European call with value $V(t)$ at time $t$. 
Assume the dealer receives the premium, $V(t_0)$ where, $t_0=0$ is initiation of said contract. The dealer sets up a dynamic hedge strategy as follows:

1. Invest the premium in a fixed income portfolio earnning $r^\xi(t,\omega)$. 
 
   - Enter into a futures contract ($0$ cost) with notional $\Delta^V_F(0)$ in future on $S$, $F_S$
2. At next time step, $t_1$ rebalance portfolio to hold $V(t_1,\omega)$ in fixed income portfolio.  
   - Enter into a futures contract ($0$ cost) with notional $\Delta^V_F(t_1, \omega)$ in future on $S$, $F_S$
   - Calculate the hedge portfolio G/L by subtracting the hedge brought forward from rebalanced position

3. Repeat 2 until expiry

Let $H^\xi$ [^xi] represent the value of the hedge portfolio then we have:

[^xi]: We use superscript $\xi$ to incidcate dependence on the funding/earned rate of the portfolio. In a situation where an insurance company is the hedger e.g. based on RILA or FIA index creding liability, the ability to fund at a higher rate is important. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
H^\xi(t_0, \omega) &:=V(t_0, \omega)\\
H^\xi(t_1^-, \omega) &=V(t_0, \omega)e^{r^\xi(t_0, \omega)\Delta t_1}+ \Delta^V_F(t_0, \omega)\underbrace{\Big(F_S(t_1, \omega)-F_S(t_0, \omega)\Big)}_{\Delta F_S(t_1)}\\
H^\xi(t_1, \omega) &:= V(t_1, \omega)\\
\Delta H^\xi(t_1, \omega)& := H^\xi(t_1, \omega)- H^\xi(t_1^-, \omega)\\
 &= V(t_1, \omega) - \Big[ V(t_0, \omega)e^{r^\xi(t_0, \omega)\Delta t_1}+ \Delta^V_F(t_0, \omega)\Delta F_S(t_1)\Big]\\
 &\vdots\\
H^\xi(t_k^-, \omega) &=V(t_{k-1}, \omega)e^{r^\xi(t_{k-1}, \omega)\Delta t_k}+ \Delta^V_F(t_{k-1}, \omega)\underbrace{\Big(F_S(t_k, \omega)-F_S(t_{k-1}, \omega)\Big)}_{\Delta F_S(t_k)}\\
H^\xi(t_k, \omega) &:= V(t_k, \omega)\\
\Delta H^\xi(t_k, \omega)& := H^\xi(t_k, \omega)- H^\xi(t_k^-, \omega)\\
 &= V(t_k, \omega) - \Big[ V(t_{k-1}, \omega)e^{r^\xi(t_{k-1}, \omega)\Delta t_{k}}+ \Delta^V_F(t_{k-1}, \omega)\Delta F_S(t_k)\Big]\\
 
\end{aligned}
$$

Where $0< k\le n$, and $ t_n = T$, with $V(T, \omega) =\mathcal X(T, \omega)$, the payoff of the contingent claim.

**Remark**

  1. This hedging is purely first order and in addition ensures that after each rebalance step, the hedge portfolio matches the value of the short contingent claim position of the hedger

  2. The hedger makes money at $t_k$ along the path, $\omega$ if the hedge brought forward is more than the value of the claim, i.e. $\Delta H^\xi(t_k, \omega) > 0$.
