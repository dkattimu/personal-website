## TLDR
- Central bank in developing countries should optimize/protect their forex reserves
- Conceptually, investing local currency in foreign assets is equivalent to purchasing USD with local currency and then investing the USD in international financial markets. This is an example of a capital outflow.
- The above two activities can be contradictory
- The local central banks typically place constraints on capital outfows with the goal of protecting their (central bank's) forex reserves. The restriction of interest to us in this article is the maximum allocation of investments of institutional investors in general, and pension funds in particular to foreign assets. 
- Advantages of supporting forex goes without saying
- This typically leads to restriction on locally managed portfolios e.g. pension funds in international Markets

- But there are advantages to investing in international markets:
   - it provides more investment opportunities 
      - more asset classes means more robust portfolio and investment risk management, including 
      - more liquidity supports retirement needs are met in a timely manner
      - Helps manage inflation risk of pension funds implicitly (hedging local currency depreciation against USD as general trend has been loss of local currency value relative to USD)

We assume the central bank forex reserves are in USD (alternatively, we could consider only the USD component of the local central bank's forex reserves). The local central bank has foreign exchang reserves as one category of assets on its balance sheet. When USD is needed e.g. to pay of imports, to pay for USD-denominated assets, the central bank sells the USD to say local banks and 

capital outflows in this article refer to local investors investing in foreign (USD)-denominated assets.
