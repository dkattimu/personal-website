# Covid Policy Response: A "Science" or Risk Management Problem

## Summary
  Policy makers have fundamentally misclassifed and mishandled Covid response by framing a risk management problem as a science problem. This has led to obfuscating, and contradictory communication, policy prescriptions etc, that has further eroded the confidence of the public in the "expert class". Full disclosure, though I may be considered an expert, I am perfectly fine with skeptism with experts. However, the expert class should be improving credibility not eroding it.
