description: Is free will a thing or just a figment of our misguided imaginations

## Introduction

The concept of free-will is a metaphysical one that arises both in atheistic and theistic philosophical circles. However, the concept intersects other fields of study including ethics, science (biology, physics, etc.). The concept has since entered into the zeitgeist as well as evidenced by hits on youtube for searches related to "Free will". Judging anecdotally by popular culture, it would seems "the smart kids on the block" have conclused that there is no such thing as free will.
From our perspective, this is another example of ambiguous communication that we will try to disambiguate as much as possible in this article.
To do that, we will start with a definition of the concept of free-will and show that arguments for or against the concept are seldom clear and the conclusions as obvious
as some may like or even pretend it to be. We will also show that no-one actually believes in a certain understanding of the absence of free will.

## Preliminaries

We start with the sequence referenced in the pop-culture version of this article:
$$
\begin{align}
\underbrace{\text{urge(s)}}_{\mathcal u \subset\mathbb U} \to \underbrace{\text{delibration(s)}}_{\mathcal t \subset \mathbb T} \to\underbrace{\text{decision}}_{\mathcal d \subset \mathbb D} \to\underbrace{\text{action}}_{\mathcal a \subset \mathbb A}
\end{align}
$$
We will put the framework in a probabilistic setting:
- This is pragmatic as even in the (unlikely) case that strict determinism (effectively fatalism) is true, we have no way of predicting with certainty decisions of an individual in the future. 
- We will consider an information flow according to time [^time-theory]. Assume the phases occur at times $s, t, u$ where $s\le t\le u$. For an individual, the urge can be represented as $\mathcal u \big(s, (\mathcal E_t)_{-\infty\lt t \le s}\big)$ 
- Let $t_0$ generically represent the current time. Let $t_* >t_0$ be time for a decision. Then assuming information flow is encapsulated by a filteration $(\mathcal F_t)_{t\ge 0}$. [^big-bang]
- 

[^big-bang]:We assume $t=0$ to be begining of time. This is arguably the consensus of time having a begining at the big-bang. This is essentially a convention that is not critical for the exposition e.g. One could index with $t\gt \infty$.

[^time-theory]: We will presupose the A-theory of time which which asserts that the _flow of time_ i.e. past, present and future are an objective reality. For completeness, there is also a so-called B-theory of time which asserts that notwithstanding the relation of past, present and future of time, all time are equaly existent and the distinction between them is purely subjective.
