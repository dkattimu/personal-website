description: Arguably a saner approach to nuclear non-proliferation than what the experts have utilized so far
---

## TLDR
- Nuclear non-proliferation describes efforts to prevent spread of nuclear weapons to nations that do not posses them and prevent the increase in existing stocks of those that do.
- A number of countries are believed to or/
and acknowledged their possession of nuclear weapons. These include the major nuclear powers of Russia, USA, China, France, UK, Pakistan, India, Israel & North Korea, in decreasing order of number of warheads [^is-nukes].

[^is-nukes]: See https://www.icanw.org/nuclear_arsenals (Retrieved 10/28/2024). Note that the Israeli goverment has not officially acknowledged that it has nukes, it is widely believed that it has.

- Irespective of "good" motives, the intervention in Libya was misguided and has resulted in disastrous consequences. One big consequence is that it throws a big wrench into non-proliferation goals that NATO supports.

- If the State dept is serious about nuclear non-proliferation, there should be iron-clad orthodoxy framework to deal with leaders that give up their nuclear weapons that is based on realities of how incentives affect human actions.

- The fundamental framework should be that, any leader that makes meaningful concessions on nukes should have a _credible_ reward of "immunity". This raises questions of granting implicit impunity to such leaders. However, this immunity isn't immunity from all consequences; it is immunity from active regime change efforts against world leaders who make nuclear concessions. This is a more tenable long-term strategy.


## The Libya Case
Libya pre 2011 was consistently among the top-ranking countries in Africa based on gdp-per capita. In 2011, there was a civil war that challenged the leadership of the country's long-reigning leader, Muammar Gaddafi. Under objective observable standards, Gaddafi's rule delivered positive economic results for Libya. On the other hand, sundry evidence have been adduced regarding human rights abuses of dissenters, together with support for a number of rebel forces in civil wars across the African continent that resulted in heinous acts against civilians.

Prior to the civil war, Gaddafi had a weapons program that was believed to include nukes. However, he gave those up in an attempt at rapproachment with the West after the invasion of Iraq in 2003[^only-adv]. Indeed, these actions and signals culminated in a meeting with then Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. It has also been revealed that Gaddafi had a "crush" on the former secretary of state[^crush].
[^only-adv]: It is now widely accepted that the justification for this invasion was flawed. Some claim it was a failure of intelligence, whereas others point to a pattern which either a consious or sub-concious propensity of the so-called military industrial complex to profit, among other hypotheses. We do not make a judgement on these debatable and "invisible" motives of the key players, but stake the claim the outcome has been a net negative. On the other hand, the only arguably positive outcome of that invasion was the decision by Gadaffi to give up his weapons program. This positive outcome was then quickly negated by NATO actions in Libya.

[^crush]:See https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/08/qaddafi-has-long-been-condoleezza-rices-not-so-secret-admirer/338718/ (retrieved 10/30/2024).

When the civil war erupted, NATO [^nato] directly intervened, directly leading to the deposition and death of Muammar Gaddafi. 
[^nato]: Though framed as a NATO intervention, this was effectively a US intervention becasue though France was "leading" the operations (and as President Obama infamously said, the US led from behind), the intervention wouldn't have happened if there was objection from President Obama. US involvement was also higher than those of France. 

In an interview with ABC news in 2011[^abc-int], after Gaddafi's demise, Condoleezza Rice acknowledged his (Gadaffi's) apparent fascination (or maybe obsession) with her. Evidence of that includes Gadaffi creating a picture album showing her with world leaders, followed by an original song by a top Libyan composer called "Black Flower in the White House". In that same interview, Rice outlined that the aim of the visit was to deliver the "quid quo pro" after Libya gave up WMD's. She later mentioned that though the priority was to get Libya out of terrorism and get Gadaffi away from WMD's, "it's was far preferrable that he is gone".
Here is the problem with this:
- It was diplomatically misguided to make such statements about it being better he was gone "in public" after the events that transpired. How does that impact future attempts to either coax a smaller nuclear power down the road to give up their nukes?
- A precedence had been set that the US cannot be trusted in this particular matter. Though a case can be made that foreign policy-related promises made by one US administration should be adhered to by other administrations, such a general rule might be problematic; it effectively locks-in potentially bad foreign policy decisions by prior administration. We will thus stick to the particular special case pertaining to non-proliferation. 
- Instead, when a nation's leader agrees to give up its weapons program, key stakeholders (NATO) should manage that regime to it's conclusion without overthrowing the leader. This is not a risk-free proposition but we maintain the alternative has higher geopolitical risk.
- In addition, with the current geopolitical realities [^geopol], we may as well kiss the goal of nuclear proliferation goodbye and expect that countries like North Korea would not give up their nukes unless somehow a new leader that was enamored with the west came into power.
- NATO by increasing the risk of overthrow of a leader with with a nuke program after he gave them up, has resulted in the situation uhere the world effectively has to deal with nations with nukes e.g. North Korea for longer. Wouldn't it have been better to manage the Gadaffi situation better, providing an incentive to have North Korea eliminate it's nukes before the end of their current leader's rule [^cynic]?
[^geopol]: Before the Ukrainian war, all countries at least pretended to be for de-nuclearization of the Korean Penninsular. With the current rift, Russia is formally aligned with North Korea. She has at least apparently shown that the West's system of sanctions can be survived. 
[^cynic]: OK, the cynic might say even if the West intended not to still overthrow leaders who gave up their nukes, why not at least wait to have the most dangerous of leaders give up their nukes first before working against them openly? Though we don't endorse such an approach, we believe competent beauraucrats should at the minimum have preferred such a strategy.

[^abc-int]: See https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/condoleezza-rice-on-her-eerie-encounter-with-gadhafi-how-quickly-can-i-get-out-of-here (retrieved 10/30/2024)

Though we empathize with the sentiments of some that Gadaffi had done bad things [^gadaffi-evils] and thus deserved his fate, we contend that in the grand scheme of things, the actions of NATO were bone-headed and lacked any deeper strategic thought. 

[^gadaffi-evils]: Those we empathize with include families of terrorist attacks he was complicit in, victims of brutal civil wars, e.g. Liberia, Sierra Leone where he funded/supported the rebel groups, victims of notorious leaders like Idi Amin that he supported. 

## A better Strategy
We propose a more optimal abstract rule for this case. This is: a leader[^dictator] that gives up their nukes should not be "regime-changed" by stakeholders including US/NATO. How should that have been handled in Libya? On the one hand, NATO could have negotiated a middle-ground in the civil war. It had leverage on both sides : threat of direct intervention (which should have been expertly weilded behind closed doors), while weilding similar leverage on the rebels as well. The goal would be to ensure that other leaders with nukes dismiss/minimize the risk that giving up leverage leaves them more vulnerable. We do realize the real world is messy but ultimately managing Gadaffi to the end of his reign (presumably till the end of his life) would have resulted in a net better outcome; NATO would have avoided the terrible record of another insular and poorely reasoned regime change, whereas still leaving as a viable option the possibility of getting at least a few other nuclear powers to give up their nukes.

We pre-empt some objections to the strategy above which would be along the lines of "he was killing his own people". That may be true, but in a war, each side is trying to kill the other side. In addition, we got what the experts wanted and what has been the result? A failed Libyan state. Gadaffi's arsenal has been reported to fall into the hands of insurgent groups in the area. There is strong evidence to suggest that has been a boon resulting in insurgent activities in all the further south in countries like Burkina Faso (just north of the coastal nation of Ghana in West Africa)


[^dictator]: We exclude terms like "dictator" in this article not because we think none of the characters fit such a discription; we believe a zietgeist that is sensitive to the feeling of people is out of it's mind in insisting on antagonizing a group of individuals that have within their ability the means to cause extreme arguable "mass-extinction" events. 

## Current Geo-Political Realities
The regime of sanctions has lost what some might argue a large amount of deterrent effect. This is a result of Russia's ability to withstand them at least up to this point. We would to attribute this to a mis-management and lack of creativity and pragmatism of the so-called foreign policy establishment of the west in dealing with the Ukraine-Russia conflict. We believe this has been another own-goal through an epic bungling of tools of diplomacy by the West's expert class.[^validity]


## Conclusion
We have made the argument that by insular and seemingly knee-jerk reactions of the foreign policy establishment, US foreign policy experts have sabotaged the long-term strategic imperitives that have been signaled. It is sometimes difficult to explain how seemingly experienced, well-educated and credentialed people make such strategically unwise decisions, but here we are.

[^validity]: This article is not about staking moral claims and/or declarations regarding "democray", "dictatorships", justification of either side's actions etc. Serveral such talk/articles exist on the internet; we don't intend to add to that genre of work. In this article we take a pragmatic posture in addressing the crux of the issues, decisions and implications thereof. In addition, we expect a modicum of intellectual maturity of the reader. This is the acumen to differentiate between a prediction or explanation of an outcome vs an endorsement of said outcome.
