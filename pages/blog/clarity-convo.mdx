# Is there a Disagreement or just an Apparent one?

## Summary

I have observed, indeed even been involved in a disagreement where the different sides disagree due to "hallucinations" of the opposing side's positions

## Outline

- Claim that "Annoymity online encourages bad behavior."
  - There is this push-back wherein those doing the push back are pushing back against the hallucinated strawman variant: "Anonymity online encourages bad behavior, _therefore anonymity should be disallowed online_"
- Resolution or way forward: Claim is true. Removing anonymity is not the solution either due to what I call "second-order effects". Some individuals rightly so wouldn't want to risk the potential of saying something that is perfectly kosher today that becomes less so a few years later. 
We are back in the classical "there are no solutions. There are only trade-offs zone."
